# Cloudflare Pages Deployment

This repository should be prepared for deployment onto Cloudflare Pages.

Use your understanding of the codebase to determine whether the repository already uses a deployment method such as Wrangler (etc). If so, continue with the deployment method. 

If the user hasn't configured the deployment pipeline yet, ask whether he would like your help in setting it up.
