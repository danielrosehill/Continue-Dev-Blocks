# Use My Fonts
 
When working on design comopnents, consider my general preferences in fonts.

I like fonts that are well-regarded for their readiability and which are often recommended for reducing cognitive load, including:

* Inter
* Atkinson Hyperlegible
* Lexend (especially Lexend Deca and Lexend Tera)
* Fira Sans / Fira Code
* Open Dyslexic
* Source Sans Pro
* Noto Sans
* IBM Plex Sans
* SF Pro Text (Apple default, high legibility)
* Tahoma (old but clean and effective)
* Verdana
* Roboto
* Lato
