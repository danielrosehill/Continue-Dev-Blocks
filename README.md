| `/deployment` | Deployment configuration and instructions |
| `/design` | Design specifications and assets |
| `/dev-preferences` | Development environment preferences and configurations |
| `/documentation` | Detailed documentation for using the blocks |
| `/environment` | Environment setup instructions and configurations |
| `/formatting` | Code formatting and style guides |
| `/foundationali` | Foundation AI personality and base behavior definitions |
| `/functions` | Specialized function blocks for specific tasks |
| `/negative-instructions` | Blocks defining behavior boundaries and restrictions |
| `/personalties` | Various AI personality configurations |
| `/preferences` | User preference configurations |
| `/python` | Python-specific configurations and utilities |
| `/stack-choices` | Technology stack configurations and recommendations |
| `/stylistic-guides` | Style guidelines for code generation |
| `/task-delination` | Task boundary definitions and workflows |
| `/workflow` | Workflow patterns and processes |

## Usage

These configuration blocks can be used with Continue.dev and similar AI-assisted development tools. Import the relevant blocks to customize your AI assistant's behavior, personality, and functionality according to your project needs.

## Development Preferences

The repository includes various development preferences such as:

- Docker integration (using latest image versions by default)
- Code formatting standards
- Environment configurations

## Workflows

Several workflow patterns are available for different development scenarios:

| Workflow | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| Document Exchange | Patterns for exchanging documentation with the AI assistant |
| Feature Addition | Guidelines for implementing new features in existing code |
| Starting from Prompt | Workflows for beginning development from a text prompt |

## Foundation AI

The base AI personality layer is defined in the `/foundationali` directory, establishing the core behavior and characteristics of the AI assistant (Herman Poppleberry).

## Functions

Specialized function blocks provide task-specific capabilities:

| Function | Purpose |
|----------|---------|
| SEO Audit | Tools for analyzing and improving SEO performance |
| Stack Researcher | Intelligent analysis of technology stacks with optimization recommendations |

## Documentation

Comprehensive documentation is available in the `/documentation` directory, providing guidance on how to effectively utilize the configuration blocks in your development workflow.

## Environment

Environment setup instructions ensure consistent development environments across different systems and platforms.
